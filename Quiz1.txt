QUIZ QUESTIONS

Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 10. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name as it appears on your ID card 
     as well as the last 5 digits of your student ID in large font at the top of every web page dispayed (for this quiz)
     On the first page show either the picture md.jpg or your picture below your name and ID number.

	  <center><img src="../static/md.jpg"> </center>
<table style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">
    
 11. Through a web interface (page), allow user to give a single row number and you will show the names, seats and   
     picture of anyone on that row on a web page.
	if request.method == "POST":
        row = request.form["name"]
        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(open("static/q1c.csv"))
        temp_path = ""
        seat = 0
        for r in csv_reader:
            if row == r["row"]:
                temp_path = "../newQuiz1/static/" + r["pic"]
                seat = r["seat"]
                name = r["name"]

        if temp_path != "":
            return render_template(
                "sxdsearchbyname.html",
                image_path=temp_path,
                name=name,
                seat=seat,
                message="found",
            )
        else:
            return render_template("sxdsearchbyname.html", error="Not found!")



 12. Through a web interface (page), allow user to give a range of rows or a single seat letter (or both), and you show 
     the corresponding matching names, seats, notes and pictures (or show "no information or picture available"). 
     (If both given, show only exact matches, if there are any. Some examples are: "Rows 30 through 40" - two matching or 
      "Seat d" - 2 matching, or "rows 20 through 40, seat c" - no matching.)
	if request.method == "POST":
        r1 = request.form["r1"]
        r2 = request.form["r2"]
        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(open("static/q1c.csv"))
        temp_path = ""
        temp_name = ""
        temp_notes = ""
        temp_seat = ""
        temp_row = ""
        count = 0
        for r in csv_reader:
            if r1 <= r["row"] and r2 >= r["row"]:
                count += 1
                temp_notes = r["notes"]
                temp_path = "../newQuiz1/static/" + r["pic"]
                temp_name = r["name"]
                temp_seat = r["seat"]
                temp_row = r["row"]
        if count != 0:
            return render_template("grade.html", error="no data found")
        else:
            return render_template(
                "grade.html",
                image_path=temp_path,
                name=temp_name,
                seat=temp_seat,
                row=temp_row,

                notes=temp_notes,
                message="found",
            )


 13. Allow a user to add a new user, delete a user, or modify any attribute of an existing user (by name) 
	new

        temp_picture.filename,
